## Unity Basics

wasd_movement_2d variation: Pressing space turns the sprite invisibile.

space_to_jump_2d variation: Added horizontal movement using the "a" and "d" keys.

space_double_jump variation: Removed the jump limit, allowing the player to jump as many times as desired. Additionally, changed it to on key down so that the user cannot just hold the space bar to rise, they must tap to jump.

wasd_speed_direction_2d variation: Heavily decreased the speed at which the squares move to make it more playable. Additionally, increased the size of the squares so that they are easier to see.

space_to_shoot_2d variation: Set a limit to the number of bullets that can be fired. Once at the limit, the user must press "r" to reload the bullets, allowing them to fire 6 more.
